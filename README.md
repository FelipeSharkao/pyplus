# pyplus
This is a in-development package for all those good things python lacks, like a classic `for`, `async` and `promise` from JS with those sweet sweet anonymous functions.  

### Instalation
Simply put the `pyplus` folder in your project root. Soon it will be avaliable as a package on *PyPI* so you can install with *pip*.

## foreach
Use the `@foreach` decorator to construct a very interactive *for* and *foreach*, giving you full control of the execution stream.

## More coming soon
