# pyplus
This is a in-development package for all those good things python miss, like a classic `for`, `async` and `promise` from JS with those sweet sweet anonymous functions.

# foreach
Use the `@foreach` decorator to construct a very interactive *for* and *foreach*, giving you full control of the execution stream.

### More coming soon
